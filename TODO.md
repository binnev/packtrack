- option to sort by time / carrier

    - ~~maybe give PackageStatus::Error an item containing the error?~~
    - ~~or properly type the `dict[status, Vec<Package> | Vec<Error>]`~~
- tui spinners when waiting for tasks
- show URL next to errors so we know which error belongs to which URL
- `url prune` cli command to prune delivered packages 
- `url add` command to fail if the url is already in the file
- `url remove` to accept substring / regex (so you can remove by barcode)
- more advanced url file where you can add annotations, for those urls that don't contain your postcode. YAML?
- `track` cli command that accepts a url
- cache the responses for each package
    - so you can show the changes over time.
    - also reuse recently fetched responses
    - composed Tracker struct with child 
        - Requester 
        - Parser
        - Cacher
